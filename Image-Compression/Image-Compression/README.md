# Image Compression Repository

This repository contains two main folders, each serving a different purpose in the context of image compression techniques. The details of each folder are outlined below:

## Folder 1: image-compression-comparison

The "image-compression-comparison" folder contains the main code and relevant documentation for image compression techniques and comparisons.

For detailed instructions, code explanations, and usage guidelines, please refer to the specific README.md file inside the "image-compression-comparison" folder.

## Folder 2: JPEG-Compression

The "JPEG-Compression" folder focuses specifically on the JPEG compression algorithm, which is widely used for lossy compression of digital images. This folder contains code and a README file that provides insights into the JPEG compression process. However, please note that the code in this folder is an experimental implementation attempting to replicate JPEG compression from scratch. It may still require further enhancements and improvements.

To learn more about using the "JPEG-Compression" folder and exploring the code, please refer to the README.md file contained within that folder.

### Note: Ensure that you read the specific README.md files inside each folder

By organizing the repository into these two distinct folders, users can easily identify and access the main image compression code in the "image-compression-comparison" folder, while also having the option to explore the experimental implementation of JPEG compression in the "JPEG-Compression" folder.
