# Digital Image Processing

This repository contains Python implementations of key **digital image processing** techniques, including:

- **Downsampling & Interpolation** (Nearest Neighbor & Bilinear Interpolation)
- **Image Enhancement** (Power Law Transformation & Histogram Equalization)
- **Geometric Transformations** (Rotation, Scaling, Translation, Shearing)
- **Shading Correction** (Lowpass Filtering for Removing Lighting Effects) 

Each folder contains a **Python script** and a detailed **README.md** explaining the concept.
